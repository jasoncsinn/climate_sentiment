# Sentiment analysis on major climate change events

## Direction and Summary
The goal of this project is to analyze major climate change events and discuss their effect on the sentiments of active twitter users. 
This is to be done by using natural language processing (NLP) techniques in machine learning.
A linear support vector classifier is used to determine a user's sentiment on climate change.
Based on this classifier, changes in a user's sentiment can be analyzed over a period of time.
