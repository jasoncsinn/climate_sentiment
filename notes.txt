papers:
	- tracking climate change opinions from twitter data (northeastern university)
		- subjective vs. objective tweets classification (preprocess?)
		- naive-bayes vs. SVM
		- nb produced slightly higher results (~76% vs. 75%)
	- signals of doubt: text mining climate skepticism (Boussalis)
		- LDA: latent dirichlet allocation
			- break into topics
			- topics contain certain words	
	- climate change sentiment on twitter: an unsolicited public opinion poll (cody, university of vermont)
		- hedonometer: measures "happiness" of a users tweet based on word indexing
		- studies of hashtags and how much each word in the dictionary correlates to the happiness score
		- word shift graphs
	- mining and summarizing customer reviews (minqing hu, university of illinois at chicago)
		- interesting flowchart of sentiment analysis in text
	- understanding climate change tweets: an open source toolkit for social media analysis (maynard, university of sheffield)
		- named entity recognition
			- identify which words are named entities
			- classify named entities

Vince's co-op report:
	- from the discussions section, it seems as though the classifier was alright (although i never was able to get 80-85%.. maybe i'm using an outdated version of the code)
	- seems as though creating and analyzing graphs and data from the classifier will be a big part of the work this term

Vince's code:
	- test.py seems to contain most of the code, and runs the training set and validates with the test set with a 64% accuracy when i ran it
		- this is similar to NE uni paper, but appears as though the dataset was not quite as "good"
	- a number of graphing functions
	- lots of data
	- from a lot of the programs, it seems as though i don't have some of the datasets that he was using.. perhaps he modified them or changed them to be better

it seems like an important part of the papers is related to preprocessing the tweets
	- because tweets are quite contextual and ambiguous, finding good data is probably quite difficult

possible areas of interest:
	- using classification algorithms to analyze impact of climate change events on twitter users' sentiments
	- choice of classification techniques, algorithms
	- preprocessing and choosing good data to learn from and use
		- improving training set and learn how to better set up filters for future tweets
